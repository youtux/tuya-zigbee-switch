# Builds debugging firmware for a single device using the build system.
# Updates indexes, converters, quirks, extensions and supported devices list.

# Estimated runtime: 5 seconds

# Requires dependencies, sdk and toolchain.

# Debug flag enables prints. To view them:
#   connect a serial monitor to the UART TX pin.

# Suggestion: Copy this script to a gitignored folder
#   and update it for your device.
